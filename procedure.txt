1. Install Atom editor with Platform.io plugins to your computer
2. Get an Arduino Uno, and connect the Arduino to your computer's USB input with a USB breakout
--Setting up luminosity sensor--
3. Plug the sensor's SCL into the Arduino's SCL, using a male/female small Wire
4. Plug the sensor's SDA into the Arduino's SDA, again using another male/female Wire
5. Using a small red wire, connect the senor's VIN to the arduino's 5.0v (5 Volt) port
6. Using a small black wire, connenct the sensor's GND (Ground, or negative) to the arduino's GND
7. Go to https://learn.adafruit.com/tsl2561/arduino-code, and download the Adafruit_TSL2561
V2 Library and the Adafruit_Sensor Library. They are the two big green buttons at the top of
the page. Extract both libraries into the lib section of the atom editor project files
--Setting up current Sensor--
9. plug the sensor's VCC into the second Arduino 5.0v
10. Plug the sensor's GND into a different GND on the arduino
11. Plug the sensor's SCL into the arduino's A5 (Analog 5)
12. Plug the sensor's SDA into the arduino's A4 (Analog 4)
13. Go to https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ina219-current-sensor-breakout/arduino-code, and download the Adafruit_INA219.
It is the big green button at the top. Then, like the light sensor libraries, extract it and place it into the lib section of the atom editor
14. go to github at ________ and download the source code, then open it in Atom. Click 'platformIO' at the top, and then click upload
